"""Beautiful Soup Elixir and Tonic - "The Screen-Scraper's Friend".

http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Beautiful Soup uses a pluggable XML or HTML parser to parse a
(possibly invalid) document into a tree representation. Beautiful Soup
provides methods and Pythonic idioms that make it easy to navigate,
search, and modify the parse tree.

Beautiful Soup works with Python 2.7 and up. It works better if lxml
and/or html5lib is installed.

For more than you ever wanted to know about Beautiful Soup, see the
documentation: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

class BeautifulSoup(Tag):
    """A data structure representing a parsed HTML or XML document.

    Most of the methods you'll call on a BeautifulSoup object are inherited from
    PageElement or Tag.

    Internally, this class defines the basic interface called by the
    tree builders when converting an HTML/XML document into a data
    structure. The interface abstracts away the differences between
    parsers. To write a new tree builder, you'll need to understand
    these methods as a whole.

    These methods will be called by the BeautifulSoup constructor:
      * reset()
      * feed(markup)

    The tree builder may call these methods from its feed() implementation:
      * handle_starttag(name, attrs) # See note about return value
      * handle_endtag(name)
      * handle_data(data) # Appends to the current data node
      * endData(containerClass) # Ends the current data node

    No matter how complicated the underlying parser is, you should be
    able to build a tree using 'start tag' events, 'end tag' events,
    'data' events, and "done with data" events.

    If you encounter an empty-element tag (aka a self-closing tag,
    like HTML's <br> tag), call handle_starttag and then
    handle_endtag.

        """Constructor.

        :param markup: A string or a file-like object representing
         markup to be parsed.

        :param features: Desirable features of the parser to be
         used. This may be the name of a specific parser ("lxml",
         "lxml-xml", "html.parser", or "html5lib") or it may be the
         type of markup to be used ("html", "html5", "xml"). It's
         recommended that you name a specific parser, so that
         Beautiful Soup gives you the same results across platforms
         and virtual environments.

        :param builder: A TreeBuilder subclass to instantiate (or
         instance to use) instead of looking one up based on
         `features`. You only need to use this if you've implemented a
         custom TreeBuilder.

        :param parse_only: A SoupStrainer. Only parts of the document
         matching the SoupStrainer will be considered. This is useful
         when parsing part of a document that would otherwise be too
         large to fit into memory.

        :param from_encoding: A string indicating the encoding of the
         document to be parsed. Pass this in if Beautiful Soup is
         guessing wrongly about the document's encoding.

        :param exclude_encodings: A list of strings indicating
         encodings known to be wrong. Pass this in if you don't know
         the document's encoding but you know Beautiful Soup's guess is
         wrong.

        :param element_classes: A dictionary mapping BeautifulSoup
         classes like Tag and NavigableString, to other classes you'd
         like to be instantiated instead as the parse tree is
         built. This is useful for subclassing Tag or NavigableString
         to modify default behavior.

        :param kwargs: For backwards compatibility purposes, the
         constructor accepts certain keyword arguments used in
         Beautiful Soup 3. None of these arguments do anything in
         Beautiful Soup 4; they will result in a warning and then be
         ignored.
         
         Apart from this, any keyword arguments passed into the
         BeautifulSoup constructor are propagated to the TreeBuilder
         constructor. This makes it possible to configure a
         TreeBuilder by passing in arguments, not just by saying which
         one to use.
